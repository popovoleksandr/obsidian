The Reason Why One Should Take Shelter of a Genuine Spiritual Master

By the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇadeva hearing, in the company of the devotees, the glories of pure devotional service, and yearning to attain that service, one should take shelter of a bona-fide spiritual master.
### Commentary by Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī
It is by the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇadeva that one attains the association of the devotees. Devotional service is more glorious than liberation. The word bhajet here means “one should take shelter".
