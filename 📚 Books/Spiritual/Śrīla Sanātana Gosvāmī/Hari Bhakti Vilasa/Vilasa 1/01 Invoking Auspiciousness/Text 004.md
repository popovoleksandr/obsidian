### Commentary by Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī
Tasting the nectar of devotional service to the lotus feet of Mathurā's master, the the devotees happily live in the land of Mathurā. In Śrī Gopāla-tāpani‘ Upaniṣad, Vṛndāvana is called “the forest of Lord Kṛṣṇa". In that forest the devotees happily enjoy pastimes of hearing and chanting Lord Kṛṣṇa's glories. The wordsa-lokanāthaḥ (with Lokanātha) indicates the close friendship between Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja and Lokanātha Gosvāmī. It was in the company of the devotees mentioned here that this book was written.
