### Commentary by Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī
The compound word mathurā-nātha-pādābja-prema-bhakti-vilāsataḥ may mean either "the book Hari-bhakti-vilāsa has come from the playful happiness of Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who is filled with love and devotion for Mathurā's master," or "the book Hari-bhakti-vilāsa has come from Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who who enjoys splendid pastimes of love and devotion for the lotus feet of Mathurā's master."

The devotees here are like bumblebees at the lotus feet of Mathurā's master. If the alternate reading "śobhayantu" is accepted, then the text reads, "the devotees of the Lord are glorious because they are faultless and because they always hear and chant the glories of the Lord." If the reading alaṅkurvantu is accepted, then the text reads, “the devotees of the Lord are decorated with all virtues, beginning with humbleness."
