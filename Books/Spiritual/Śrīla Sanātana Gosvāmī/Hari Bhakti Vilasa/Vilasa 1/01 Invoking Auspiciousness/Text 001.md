Invoking Auspiciousness

As, reflecting on what activities must be performed, and with the help of the devotees collecting many quotes from all the scriptures, I write this book for the devotees' pleasure, I take shelter of Lord Caitanyadeva

### Commentary by Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī
brahmādi-śakti-pradaṁ īśvaraṁ taṁ 
dātuṁ sva-bhaktiṁ kṛpayāvatīrṇam
caitanyadevaṁ śaraṇaṁ prāpadye 
yasya prasādāt sva-vaśe 'rtha-siddhiḥ

I take shelter of Lord Caitanyadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who empowers Brahmā and the demigods, who descended to this world to give His own devotional service, and whose mercy allows His devotees to conquer Him and bring Him under their control.

likhyate bhagavad-bhakti- 
vilāsasya yathā-mati
ṭīkā dig-darśinī nāma 
tad-ekāṁśārtha-bodhinī

This commentary, which bears the name Dig-darśinī ṭīkā (A Commentary That Shows the Direction), and which explains a small portion of the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa, has been written as far as I am able.

As I begin the difficult task of writing this book, in order to attain a good result I first take shelter of my parama-guru, my worshipable Deity, Lord Caitanya. The name Caitanya means the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the form of pure knowledge (cit), who is worshiped by all the universes, and who among all Deities has the most perfect transcendental knowledge. Or, another meaning of the name Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who stays in everyone's heart (citta). Or, another meaning of the name Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives life (cetanā) to all living entities. I take shelter of Him, Lord Caitanya, the master of my life.

Why do I write this book? I write to describe the activities that should be performed by the saintly devotees of Lord Viṣṇu. Why else do I write? I write to please them.
Someone may ask: How can a fallen person like you be successful in such a task? I reply: I shall be successful because I take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has all powers and opulences, who has a great host of virtues, beginning with His great mercy, and who Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.3.28 reveals is Lord Kṛṣṇa. In this way three parts of this verse are explained. By taking shelter of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu I will be successful in this task. That is the meaning here.

Furthermore, it is by His power, by His order, and by His glory that I am engaged in this task. I do not write by my own wish. I do not write to glorify myself.
In my opinion the perfect name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By taking shelter of His mercy this book is not at all difficult to write. Indeed, everything is done very easily. That is the meaning.
Here someone may object: All these things have already been described in the Vedas, Smṛti, Purāṇas, Agamas, and other scriptures. Why should you write something more? To this I reply: I will gather quotes from all the scriptures and put each quote in its appropriate place. That is how I will write this book.
