If the deity installation is done without sufficient wealth, it will ruin the *yajamāṇa* or the performer. If the *mantras* are not properly chanted the reactions will fall on the priests. If the deity iS not carved according to the scripture it will harm the wife of the performer. There is no greater enemy then an improperly performed deity installation. If the installation is done during an auspicious time and if there are very little blemishes made, the deity installation will bestow upon the performer all the auspiciousness, happiness, wealth and satisfaction he desires. (Nārada-Purāṇa Chapter 56.537-539)
