तदहं सम्प्रवक्ष्यामि लोकानां हितकाम्यया । 
येन विज्ञानमात्रेण सर्वज्ञत्वं प्रपद्यते ॥३॥

*tad ahaṁ sampravakṣyāmi 
lokānāṁ hita-kāmyayā 
yena vijñāna-mātreṇa 
sarvajñatvaṁ prapadyate*

**Therefore, with an eye to the public good, I shall speak that which when understood will lead to knowledge of all things in their proper perspective.**

Commentary: 
Cāṇakya Paṇḍita herewith reveals the first qualification for a man to be recognized as knowledgeable: he must understand all things “in their proper perspective.” True knowledge is sublime, broad and even. It is neither top-heavy nor cumbersome like the mental burden carried by so-called “men of letters.” Here Cāṇakya Paṇḍita promises that his instructions will “make one all-knowing.” His compassionate motives for penning his nīti-śāstra are also revealed: “to give benefit to the entire world.”

Unlike most writers of today, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita did not scribe his nīti-śāstra to see his name in print or to earn royalties. As a renounced and threadbare brāhmaṇa, the great Cāṇakya Paṇḍita had no desire for fame or riches. His goal was the upliftment and guidance of society, and that is why King Candragupta Maurya respectfully sat at his feet. The spiritual jewels of eternal wisdom are far greater than the baubles of the rich and powerful, while the power of renunciation exceeds the strength of armies.
